# Python

This repo has the python codes I'm writing as I learn python and machine learning. 

The codes are pretty much self explanatory, so please seek help if even after starting from the beginning, you don't understant what is going on. Also, I'm pretty sure that some of your entry level projects will get covered just by reading these codes. So, good luck.
